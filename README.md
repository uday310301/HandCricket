# ABSTRACT
# Title:  Hand Cricket
# Description:
Hand Cricket is a software that uses Java and Database to bring the real-life experience of the cricket into a hand cricket game.
Every match begins by choosing teams initially and 6 players from each team.
Once the players are selected, the game starts and asks the user to select one option from 0,1,2,3,4,6. Once the user selects an option, the system selects a random option. The user team loses a wicket if the option he/she selected and the random number generated are the same subjected to the condition that the option chosen by the user1 is not 0. If they are different, then the score of the user1 increases by the option he/she chose. Once the user1 team loses 5 wickets, an innings is said to get completed. The score of user1’s team will be the target for user2’s team. The rules mentioned above will also apply to the user2 while his/her team bats.
The team with higher score wins the game.
The Database tables built agree with 2NF.
